I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for solving real-word problems that involve data exploration and machine learning applications.
# [Project 1: Heart Failure Predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Brandon_Portfolio)
* Open-Source Machine Learning project from Kaggle
* Created a Deep Learning classification model that predicts whether a person will experience heart failure, based on a patient's data on medical characteristics.
* Utilizied Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and the deep learning framework Tensorflow.
* Explored and implimented optimal tuning of callbacks and early stopping to show how the model's performance changed overtime.

# [Project 2: Avocado Type Classifier: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Brandon_Portfolio)
* Another Open-Source Machine Learning project from Kaggle
* Utilized various Deep Learning methods to predict a certain type of avocado based on region and measurable features.
* Used Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and the framework Tensorflow.
* Performed data exploration and feature engineering to improve the overall performance of the model.
