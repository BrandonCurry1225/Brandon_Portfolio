# Brandon_Portfolio
I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for solving real-word problems that involve data exploration and machine learning applications.
# [Project 1: Heart Failure Predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Brandon_Portfolio)
* Open-Source Machine Learning project from Kaggle
* Created a Deep Learning classification model that predicts whether a person will experience heart failure, based on a patient's data on medical characteristics.
* Utilizied Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and the deep learning framework Tensorflow.
* Explored and implimented optimal tuning of callbacks and early stopping to show how the model's performance changed overtime.

# [Project 2: Avocado Type Classifier: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Brandon_Portfolio)
* Another Open-Source Machine Learning project from Kaggle
* Utilized various Deep Learning methods to predict a certain type of avocado based on region and measurable features.
* Used Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and the framework Tensorflow.
* Performed data exploration and feature engineering to improve the overall performance of the model.

# [Project 3: NLP Sentiment Analysis on Reviews: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Brandon_Portfolio)
* Obtained real-world data of movie reviews and Amazon product reviews.
* Used the VADER model to iterate through every review and give a sentiment score describing whether the review was predicted as negative or positive.
* Used Python Natural Language Processing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and NLTK.
* Performed feature extraction and utilized the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer.

# [Project 4: Borrower trustworthiness by FICO Score: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Brandon_Portfolio)
* Artifical Borrowers Credit Information Dataset given by online instructor.
* Used the ML Random Forest model to predict the likelihood of a borrower paying back a loan with datasets of each borrower's credit history and FICO score.
* Used Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SKLearn.
* Performed data exploration and feature engineering to obtain a cleaner dataset capable of producing a more accurate prediction of a borrower.

# [Project 5: Vehicle Detection with OpenCV: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Brandon_Portfolio)
* Used the Large Vehicle Dataset
