# Brandon_Portfolio
I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for solving real-word problems that involve data exploration and machine learning applications.
# Project 1: Heart Failure Predictor: Project Overview
* Open-Source Machine Learning project from Kaggle
* Created a Deep Learning classification model that predicts whether a person will experience heart failure, based on a patient's data on medical characteristics.
* Utilizied Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and the deep learning framework Tensorflow.
* Explored and implimented optimal tuning of callbacks and early stopping to show how the model's performance changed overtime.
