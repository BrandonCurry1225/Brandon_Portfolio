# Brandon_Portfolio
* I am an aspiring data explorer with a passion for solving real-word problems that involve data exploration and machine learning applications. 
* I have experience working with common ML modeling such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K Means Clustering, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and used deep learning neural networks such as CNNs and RNNs to put meaning into data and use data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau to tell a story. 
* I have basic experience with other deep learning applications such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, but am passionate to expand my knowledge in these fields and put them into meaningful work.
* I am actively building more projects every week and adding them onto my portfolio that cover a wide variety of skills. 

# [- TECHNICAL CERTIFICATIONS HERE -](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Technical-Certifications/blob/main/Technical%20Certifications.pdf)

# [Project 1: Heart Failure Predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Heart-Failure-Prediction-Model/blob/main/HeartFailurePredictionModel.pdf)
* Open-Source Machine Learning project from Kaggle
* Created a Deep Learning classification model that predicts whether a person will experience heart failure, based on a patient's data on medical characteristics.
* Utilizied Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and the deep learning framework Tensorflow.
* Explored and implimented optimal tuning of callbacks and early stopping to show how the model's performance changed overtime.

# [Project 2: Loan Prediction Analysis by Credit Score: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Loan-Prediction-with-ML/blob/main/LoanPredictionModel.pdf)
* An open-source Credit and Loan Information Dataset from Kaggle.
* Mainly used the ML Random Forest model to predict the likelihood of a borrower paying back a loan with datasets of each borrower's credit history and total income.
* Used Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SKLearn.
* Performed data exploration and feature engineering to obtain a cleaner dataset capable of producing a more accurate prediction of a borrower.
* Used different models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extra Tree Classifier to find which suited best.

# [Project 3: Avocado Type Classifier: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/Avocado-Type-Prediction-Project/blob/main/AvocadoTypeClassification.pdf)
* Another Open-Source Machine Learning project from Kaggle
* Utilized various Deep Learning methods to predict a certain type of avocado based on region and measurable features.
* Used Python Data Science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and the framework Tensorflow.
* Performed data exploration and feature engineering to improve the overall performance of the model.

# [Project 4: NLP Sentiment Analysis on Reviews: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-/blob/main/NLPSentimentAnalysis.pdf)
* Obtained real-world data of movie reviews and Amazon product reviews.
* Used the VADER model to iterate through every review and give a sentiment score describing whether the review was predicted as negative or positive.
* Used Python Natural Language Processing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and NLTK.
* Performed feature extraction and utilized the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer.

# [Project 5: 200 Best Horror Movies with BeautifulSoup: Project Overview](https://github.com/BrandonCurry1225/200-Best-Horror-Movies-with-BeautifulSoup/blob/main/200HorrorMoviesProject.pdf)
